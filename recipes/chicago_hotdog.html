    <h3>Make this classic Chicago-style Hot Dog at home! It's loaded with yellow mustard, sweet pickle relish, tomatoes, onions, dill pickles, sport peppers, and finished with celery salt.</h3>
    
    <p>Named for the city where this iconic dish was created, the Chicago Hot Dog is a crunchy, juicy mouthful of an all-beef hot dog.</p>
    <p>It’s “dragged through the garden,” which means it’s dressed with yellow mustard, sweet pickle relish, fresh tomatoes and onions, a dill pickle spear, spicey, pickled chilies called sport peppers, and a sprinkling of celery salt. It’s a meal and almost a salad all in one soft hot dog bun (preferably with poppy seeds).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 all-beef natural casing hot dogs</li>
        <li>8 poppy seed hot dog buns or potato buns</li>
        <li>Yellow mustard for topping</li>
        <li>Sweet pickle relish for topping</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, cut into 8 wedges each</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>8 dill pickle spears</li>
        <li>16 sport peppers or pepperoncini, whole or diced</li>
        <li>Celery salt for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium heat, 350°F. You should be able to hold your hand over the grill for about 3 seconds before it’s too hot.</li>
        <li>Place the hot dogs on the grill. Turn them with tongs as they cook, about 8 minutes total. You want a good amount of color on them. Transfer to a platter.</li>
        <li>Place a grilled hot dog in a bun. Top with yellow mustard, sweet pickle relish, 2 tomato wedges, onions, 1 dill pickle spear, and 2 sport peppers. The celery salt is strong, so you only need a light sprinkle over the dog to finish it up. Assemble the remaining hot dogs. Eat immediately!</li>
    </ol>
